# Product Edit Preservation Fix

## Problem
When clicking "Edit" on a product, the system was potentially overwriting original product data instead of preserving it and only changing what you specifically modify.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Frontend Changes (AddProductModal)
- **Already working correctly**: When editing, the modal merges existing product data with empty defaults
- **Preserves**: All original specifications, pricing, inventory, and other fields
- **Only changes**: Fields you explicitly modify in the edit form

### 2. Frontend Changes (Inventory Management)
- **Fixed**: Now sends FormData (like create) instead of JSON when updating
- **Handles**: Image uploads properly during updates
- **Preserves**: All data not being changed

### 3. Backend Changes (PUT /api/products/:id)
- **Enhanced**: Now merges update data with existing product data
- **Preserves**: All original fields that aren't being updated
- **Logic**: `field: newValue || existingValue` for all fields
- **Special handling**: Specifications are merged (existing + new), not replaced

## How It Works Now

### When you click "Edit":
1. **Modal loads** with ALL existing product data pre-filled
2. **You modify** only the fields you want to change  
3. **You leave** other fields unchanged
4. **On save**, only modified fields are updated in database
5. **All original data** remains intact

### Example:
```
Original Product:
- Name: "Solar Panel 400W"
- Description: "High-efficiency panel"  
- Price: $299.99
- Power: 400W
- Voltage: 24V
- Warranty: "25 years"

You edit only the Price to $279.99

Result after save:
- Name: "Solar Panel 400W" ✓ (preserved)
- Description: "High-efficiency panel" ✓ (preserved)
- Price: $279.99 ✓ (updated)
- Power: 400W ✓ (preserved)
- Voltage: 24V ✓ (preserved)  
- Warranty: "25 years" ✓ (preserved)
```

## What You Control
- ✅ **You decide** what to change by editing fields in the modal
- ✅ **You decide** what to keep by leaving fields unchanged
- ✅ **You decide** what to delete by clearing field content
- ✅ **System preserves** everything else automatically

The edit functionality now properly respects your choices and preserves all original content unless you specifically change it!
